                <h2>Top AI trends to look out for in 2020</h2>
                <p>
                    <h3>AI increasingly used to create films, music, and games</h3>
                    Some things, even in 2020, are probably still best left to humans. Anyone who has seen the current
                    state-of-the-art in AI-generated music, poetry or storytelling is likely to agree that the most sophisticated
                    machines still have some way to go until their output will be as enjoyable to us as the best that humans can
                    produce. However, the influence of AI on entertainment media is likely to increase. This year we saw Robert De
                    Niro de-aged in front of our eyes with the assistance of AI, in Martin Scorsese’s epic The Irishman, and the
                    use of AI in creating brand new visual effects and trickery is likely to become increasingly common.

                    In videogames, AI will continue to be used to create challenging, human-like opponents for players to compete
                    against, as well as to dynamically adjust gameplay and difficulty so that games can continue to offer a
                    compelling challenge for gamers of all skill levels. And while completely AI-generated music may not be
                    everyone’s cup of tea, where AI does excel is in creating dynamic soundscapes – think of smart playlists on
                    services like Spotify or Google Music that match tunes and tempo to the mood and pace of our everyday lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>AI will increasingly be monitoring and refining business processes</h3>
                    While the first robots in the workplace were mainly involved with automating manual tasks such as
                    manufacturing and production lines, today's software-based robots will take on the repetitive but necessary
                    work that we carry out on computers. Filling in forms, generating reports and diagrams and producing
                    documentation and instructions are all tasks that can be automated by machines that watch what we do and learn
                    to do it for us in a quicker and more streamlined manner. This automation – known as robotic process
                    automation – will free us from the drudgery of time-consuming but essential administrative work, leaving us to
                    spend more time on complex, strategic, creative and interpersonal tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Human and AI cooperation increases</h3>
                    More and more of us will get used to the idea of working alongside AI-powered tools and bots in our day-to-day
                    working lives. Increasingly, tools will be built that allow us to make the most of our human skills – those
                    which AI can't quite manage yet – such as imaginative, design, strategy, and communication skills. While
                    augmenting them with super-fast analytics abilities fed by vast datasets that are updated in real-time.

                    For many of us, this will mean learning new skills, or at least new ways to use our skills alongside these new
                    robotic and software-based tools. The IDC predicts that by 2025, 75% of organizations will be investing in
                    employee retraining in order to fill skill gaps caused by the need to adopt AI. This trend will become
                    increasingly apparent throughout 2020, to the point where if your employer isn’t investing in AI tools and
                    training, it might be worth considering how well placed they are to grow over the coming years.
